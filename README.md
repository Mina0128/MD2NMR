# Bioinformatics Capstone Project Spring 2016
Update and increase efficiency of previously written java code.

Run the script main.py with a topology (.prmtop) and trajectory (.dcd) file as arguments.

The script will:
1. Compute the distances between key atoms and the backbone hydrogens and oxygens. 
2. Produce a pattern of key atoms located near the backbone hydrogens and oxygens.
3. Produce the distances associated with the pattern of atoms.
